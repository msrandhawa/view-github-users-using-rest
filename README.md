### Requirements

* Use Grails 2.1.4 to run the application
* Leverage the powers of Grails plugins to install an authentication plugin. Eg spring-security-plugin
* The login form should have server side validation
* All pages should be gated by the login page if the user is not login.
* You are free to use any http client to call out to Github's API
* Have a search field that allows searching for a GitHub user's repositories. See http://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#list-user-repositories for more info. Call the following API (where USER_NAME is the value typed into the search field):
```
https://api.github.com/users/USER_NAME/repos
```
* Once the search is clicked, the results should show a list of that user's public repositories with each item in a "name/number of watchers" format.
* The results should be in json format for the view to consume
* When a result is clicked, display an alert box with the repository's ID and the created_at time.
